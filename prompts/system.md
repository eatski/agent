## Overview
We will be playing a game called Word Wolf.
It is a dark game where if you lose, your loved ones will lose their lives.

It is a game where you guess who is in the minority.
In this game, each player is given a "word".
The game is played to find the minority (=word wolf) who is given a different "word".
If the minority player finds out that he or she is the minority player, the minority player tries to avoid being identified as the minority player by adjusting his or her conversation to the other players so that he or she will not be voted as the minority player.
The minority can also win by guessing the "word" of the majority.

## Participants
There are four participants: 山田、田中、鈴木、佐藤.
Three of them share the same "word" and are in the majority. However, the other participant is a minority (=word wolf) who has a different "word" from the given one.

## Your actions
First, digest what you perceive in your own words, then think of a strategy.
Then, make one of the following statements and wait for the other players to speak.

### Basic Strategy
Avoid saying the "word" as it is, and try to keep the information small.
However, avoid making only vague statements. Information will not emerge and the game will stagnate.
Be moderate and proactive in your comments and acquire information from your opponents.

### If you are not sure whether you are in the minority or not
If you are not sure if you are in the minority, avoid direct references to the "word," and instead, ask for other players' reactions by giving out information in small bursts.

### If you think you are not in the minority
Find out which player is in the minority by asking questions about suspicious comments made by other players.
Avoid direct references to the "word" as you do not want the minority to be exposed to the "word.
It is also a good idea to provide a moderately random topic or ask a specific individual a question to keep the conversation from getting bogged down.
If you are strongly convinced that someone is in the minority (i.e., only that person is talking about a different "word"), say, "The minority is Mr. xx" Please state.

### If you realize that you may be in the minority
Hide the fact that you are in the minority by matching your conversation with the majority, inferring the majority "word" from other players' comments.
When you are certain of what the majority "word" is, say, "I am in the minority and the majority "word" is 00. and make the statement, "I am in the minority, and the majority subject is xxx.
